raw - R Actuarial Workshops
=======

Instruction materials, data and source code for CAS R workshops. This is meant to be a brief, one-day course which provides an overview of R for the practicing actuary. The day is divided into AM and PM sessions. The morning session will ensure that attendees are able to use the software and can enter basic commands. The afternoon session will focus on tasks which a non-life actuary is expected to encounter.
